<h2> Hi! Lets see ID selectors below.</h2>
<div id = "myDivId">Hello! I am some very very long content inside a div box. I was applied style from a ID selector from external css file!</div>
<div>You cannot have more than one element with same ID! ID should be unique. :) Lets see what happens if you use it below. Oh no you cant see it since browser wont show it:D </div>

<div id="myDivId>I am another div where I have been applied the same ID selector style. Do you think it would work on me? Can you see me on the page?</div>
